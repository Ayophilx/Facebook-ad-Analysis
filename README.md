# About Facebook Ads
Facebook Ads is a digital advertising platform that allows businesses to create and run ads targeted at specific audience segments. Through its advanced targeting options, advertisers can narrow down their audience by age, location, interests, and even behaviors, ensuring their message reaches the right people. Ads come in various formats such as images, videos, and carousels, giving advertisers flexibility in how they present their message.
The platform uses performance metrics like reach (how many people saw the ad), impressions (how often the ad was displayed), and click-through rates to measure success.
